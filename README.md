Inside  Contract/polygon_contract.sol we have the flat smart contract for the collection and can be variated depending on the parameter we want in the latest parts of the file.
which was deploid in the web of remis.ethereum.org.

inside the info/polygon.txt we have the ABI, the smart contract of the nfts and the link to the metadata.

the rest of the files are the ones incharge of all the creation of the random images and metadata that we will use to create the nfts.

The code used in order to everything related to the artCreation was based in the tutotrials made by hashlips.
